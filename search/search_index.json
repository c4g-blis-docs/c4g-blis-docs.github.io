Partner Organization \u00b6 Our partner organization is the group of labs using the C4G BLIS tool currently. C4G Basic Laboratory Information System (BLIS) is an open-source system to track patients, specimens, and laboratory results. We are working in collaboration with Dr. Vempala to coordinate communication with country level BLIS coordinators. Individual labs are using the local BLIS tool currently, but some regions have reliable internet and have made requests for an online version of the tool. We aim to work on the following specific needs: Provide a way to host BLIS in a persistent, Internet-connected way that is \u201calways on\u201d Provide a way to see the data from many labs at once Provide an updated FAQ to answer immediate questions regarding BLIS\u2019 operations Project Goals \u00b6 Main Goal \u00b6 Achievements \u00b6 TODO Feedback and Development \u00b6 We are awaiting a chance to get input from the stakeholders on their preference, but we will propose some combination of the following options for the feedback loop: Milestone check-ins Demo sessions via live meetings Sync via email channel We also outline a plan for development, evaluation, and deployment. Development: we\u2019ll develop new features utilizing version control with a forked version of the repository. Evaluation: we\u2019ll ask end users a few quantitative questions (how often they would use each new feature, on a scale of 1-5; how easy to use it was, etc.), as well as solicit qualitative feedback (is there anything they would change to make the new feature easier to use). Deployment: after new features are ready for deployment, we\u2019ll submit pull requests to the main BLIS repository. We can provide a BLIS update package for clients to use, if necessary. Finally, we note an important consideration that affected design choices. Since backwards compatibility is a key feature of BLIS, developing a hybrid server/desktop version is probably not feasible. Given that, we can add a feature to the current version of BLIS that can export and periodically upload data to a central node, which can be designed as a full server-side/cloud application.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#home","text":"","title":"Home"},{"location":"#project-demo","text":"","title":"Project Demo"},{"location":"#team","text":"Rita Borelli - DevOps Victor Li - Software Developer Mitchell Rysavy - Team Lead, Backend/Infrastructure Developer Kristy Sakano - Software Developer","title":"Team"},{"location":"#project-status-last-updated-2022-april-08","text":"After a few partner meetings, we have pivoted to only creating a version of BLIS that runs on a Docker container and can be set up as a cloud service.","title":"Project Status (last updated 2022 April 08)"},{"location":"#partner-organization","text":"Our partner organization is the group of labs using the C4G BLIS tool currently.

Quick Version \u00b6 Skip this section for step-by-step instructions on getting BLIS running. You must already have an account with a cloud provider to continue, and you must create a virtual machine running a relatively modern Linux distribution. For testing, Digital Ocean and the minimum-level $5/month droplet was used. You must install Docker Engine for the Linux distro you are running. You must install Docker Compose . Either V1 ( docker-compose ) or V2 ( docker compose ) will work, but for this example, docker-compose V1 will be used. Creating a Droplet \u00b6 You can follow the instructions on DigitalOcean to create a droplet here . Any Linux distribution should work, but for the purposes of this guide, it is assumed you will use Ubuntu. After creating the droplet, make sure you either note down the root user password you set, or you have an key configured for passwordless login. Follow the instructions here to connect to the droplet via SSH . Installing Docker \u00b6 When you are SSH'd into the droplet, in the terminal, run these commands to install Docker: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg \\ --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg echo \\ \"deb [arch= $( dpkg --print-architecture ) \\ signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] \\ https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\ $( lsb_release -cs ) stable\" | sudo tee \\ /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io Install Docker Compose V1: sudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose- $( uname -s ) - $( uname -m ) \" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Now you're ready to run BLIS! Running BLIS \u00b6 In the DigitalOcean Droplet via SSH, clone the BLIS repository: $ git clone https://github.com/c4g-spr22-blis/BLIS.git Change to the BLIS Docker directory $ cd BLIS/docker Initialize BLIS! $ docker-compose up -d These commands will set up two containers: The app container: This contains all of the BLIS source code, as well as the Apache2 web server and PHP 5.6 runtime. The db container: This contains the MySQL 5.7 database. The files inside the docker/database/ folder are executed when the container is created, providing the seed data that the BLIS database needs to start. Accessing BLIS \u00b6 Now, BLIS should be running. You can access it by visiting a URL that looks like: http://[your droplet IP address]/ Substitute your droplet IP address above - you should have this from SSHing into it. Upgrading BLIS \u00b6 When you want to upgrade BLIS, you can follow these commands to pull the latest version of the Docker image and restart the containers: $ docker-compose down $ docker-compose pull app $ docker-compose up -d And that's it! Adding an HTTPS certificate to BLIS \u00b6 By default, BLIS will only communicate over HTTP on port 80 (see docker/docker-compose.yml for the full port configuration.) BLIS includes support for automatically retrieving and configuring a certificate from Let's Encrypt for communicating over HTTPS. However, you must already have a domain configured and pointing at the host you are running BLIS on. This process is not included in this guide. If you are using DigitalOcean, there is a guide you can use as a jumping-off point here . After your domain is pointing to your BLIS host IP address \u00b6 You will need to add the BLIS_SERVER_NAME to the docker-compose.yml configuration: services: app: # This image is automatically built and pushed from the GitHub action in .github/workflows/ folder image: \"ghcr.io/c4g-spr22-blis/blis:latest\" environment: DB_HOST: 'db' DB_PORT: '3306' DB_USER: '[blis database user here]' DB_PASS: '[blis database password here]' # Add or uncomment this line, and change the domain value to your own BLIS_SERVER_NAME: 'blis.mydomain.com' Then, (re)start BLIS: # if BLIS is running $ docker-compose down # bring the database container up first and daemonize it $ docker-compose up -d db # bring the app container up alone, syncronously, so we can see the output $ docker-compose up app Make sure there are no errors in the output. The container will attempt to read the value of BLIS_SERVER_NAME and set the appropriate ServerName directive in the Apache2 web server configuration and a message will say that it is successful. Assuming it is successful, you can quit with Ctrl-C and restart as a background process ( docker-compose up -d app ). In a separate terminal window, while BLIS is running, run the script: $ docker-compose exec app get-https-cert.sh This will verify the environment configuration seems correct and execute the certificate tool for you! Answer the questions about the domain to the best of your knowledge. Once the domain is verified and the certificate installed, you can visit your BLIS instance with an https:// URL and hopefully it just works! Troubleshooting \u00b6 There maybe a error when you call docker-compose API, the error will show similar to: root@blis-test:~/BLIS/docker#docker-compose -bash: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose: Permission denied Using a chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose will help the work.","title":"Running BLIS on a Cloud Provider"},{"location":"developer_documentation/blis_cloud/#running-blis-on-a-cloud-provider","text":"There is experimental support for running BLIS on a cloud provider in the form of a Docker container!","title":"Running BLIS on a Cloud Provider"},{"location":"developer_documentation/blis_cloud/#quick-version","text":"Skip this section for step-by-step instructions on getting BLIS running.

The AMP Stack \u00b6 BLIS seems to come from a time when web development was a bunch of scripts dropped in a folder and expected to work. This was common for the era, and it was/is called *AMP stack. Commonly LAMP or WAMP, it stands for \"Linux (or Windows) Apache MySQL PHP.\" The Apache Web server : this is an oldie but a goodie, it's one of the most commonly used web servers on the Internet. Unfortunately, that can mean it's a little bit more difficult to configure since there are a lot of options, but fortunately we don't need anything complicated. MySQL : This is one of the most popular SQL databases, and it used to be a more popular choice until Oracle got its hands on it. PHP : A scripting language that is extremely popular and therefore, a common attack vector. PHP remains popular because it is very easy to learn. Getting AMPed Up \u00b6 BLIS runs on Windows, but the software it's built on started on *nix servers.For that reason, it will sound silly, but I recommend the following resources for familiarizing yourself with the stack: Create a virtual machine of the latest Ubuntu (can be either Server edition or Desktop edition, but you will be using the terminal a bit either way) Familiarize yourself with the Web Servers section of the Ubuntu Server Guide. Goals: Install Apache View the sample web page that proves Apache is running If you are unsure of the purpose of a web server or how the HTTP protocol works, you can read about HTTP on the MDN website . Install MySQL on Ubuntu (just the Installation section, unless you want to read further). Read the section on LAMP Applications . Goals: Install phpMyAdmin and view the interface in your browser Now that you have a LAMP stack (good job!) you get to install WordPress! Their installation process used to be called \"The Famous Five-Minute Install\" but it seems like they changed it. Regardless, you can read up here . Goals: Make a wordpress blog that's hosted in your VM. That's the *AMP Stack! Back to BLIS \u00b6 BLIS, of course, does not run on Linux (easily, anyway), but hopefully by now you should be familiar with the different pieces and how they work together. As far as I can tell, BLIS is all of these applications in their Windows form, bundled together with a set of configuration files that provide the bare minimum needed to get BLIS up and running on a single computer. Which actual files those are, are not clear to me since there are some duplicates. In the Browser \u00b6 I think these technologies are ones that make more sense if you learn as you go, but it's good to have some reference material ready that you can use when you need it. For reading up about web development technologies in terms of what happens in the browser, I'd recommend reading the Mozilla Developer Network. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript as well as the introductory documentation of jQuery, a library that used to be popular because developing for different browsers was terrible (and BLIS seems to use it still). https://learn.jquery.com/","title":"Mitchell's Fast & Furious Web Development Crash Course"},{"location":"developer_documentation/webdev-notes/#mitchells-fast-furious-web-development-crash-course","text":"This is my super-duper quick, off-the-cuff, and totally unprofessional guide to getting up to speed in web development as it related to BLIS.","title":"Mitchell's Fast &amp; Furious Web Development Crash Course"},{"location":"developer_documentation/webdev-notes/#the-amp-stack","text":"BLIS seems to come from a time when web development was a bunch of scripts dropped in a folder and expected to work.
